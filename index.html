      <h3>My fellow counterparts,</h3>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">The day has finally come. I have made the BONANZA fantasy football playoffs. To say I’m thrilled would be an understatement. It is truly an honour to be a part of such an elite group of teams and managers. I never would have guessed Robin & Son would make the playoffs after some poor draft capital management last year. Despite the challenge and the 1-3 start to the season, this team fought through adversity all season, whether it was name-calling, blow-out losses, or Henry Ruggs deciding it was time to end his NFL career. To change their fortunes, Robin & Son made some interesting, yet helpful deals, including flipping Sprainy Watkins for Miles Gascan, a keeper switch sending Metcalf for Diggs, re-acquiring Michael Carter, and acquiring one of the most consistent fantasy football players in Mike Evans. While these moves propelled Robin & Son to the next level, the job is far from done. Now that Robin & Son are #playoffbound, there are several people I need to thank.</h5>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">First and foremost, I need to thank A.J. Green. The man was possessed last night and you could see it as soon as the game started, going 7 for 10 for 102 yards. An electric performance that will go down as one of the most important performances over my fantasy football career. To A.J., thank you. 
</p>
<p class="w3-text-grey">
Secondly, I need to thank Agholory Holes and the savvy management of Stu. After seeing the potential lineup on Tuesday and the nightmare fuel it provided me, Stu made every move necessary to spoil the playoff hopes of BLANDrew CRAPeron and Derrilick my Balls. I promised a beer next time I see him, and I will hold myself to that. Stu, cheers to you, my friend. 
</p>
<p class="w3-text-grey">
Thirdly, I need to thank all of you who were proud to stand with BADley this week. The BADley baddies provided unwavering support over the weekend and instilled a new sense of confidence in myself and Robin & Son. 
</p>
<p class="w3-text-grey">
Also, I need to thank myself. Giving myself a real good pat on the back as you read this. 
</p>
<p class="w3-text-grey">
Lastly, and most importantly, I must thank BLANDrew and Derrilick my Balls. At 7-4 through Week 11, this team was destined for the playoffs. However, after posting 3 straight losses this team should feel embarrassed. Although I would like to continue to gloat about how I beat BLANDrew out of the playoff picture in Football BONANZA, I would be remised if I didn’t bring up the fact that I also beat this manager for 3rd place in Baseball BONANZA. This fantasy sports season has truly been magical for myself, and an absolute Derrikick in the Balls for BLANDrew. To the manager who doesn’t like to be on the screen during fantasy sports drafts so people don’t laugh at, and judge, his picks, we’re all laughing now. Better luck next year, eh wha?
</p>
<p class="w3-text-grey">
I recognize how lucky and fortunate I am to be playing in the BONANZA Football playoffs this year and I am happy to report that the monkey has been tossed off my back. Being included in such an elite group of managers and teams means the world to me. As an aside, Robin & Son will be re-branding for the PlayoffSZN. Stay tuned for more updates. I am now looking forward to competing against Kliff’s House of Cards and potentially being the big bad wolf that knock his house down. 
</p>
<p class="w3-text-grey">
All the best you filthy animals,
